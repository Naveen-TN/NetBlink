Simple ..

Just download all these three files into a folder of your choice and run the exe file.

If the internet is active , it will be in green color.

If the internet is down , it will alternate between red and green.

The IP it pings is 8.8.8.8 google DNS.

Nothing fancy.

Also included a right-click quit button. If you want it to start on windows boot , place them in startup folder (all three files.)
